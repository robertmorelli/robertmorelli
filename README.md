# Robert Morelli 

**Currently Working On:**
- Speeding up and improving my SVG animator (rewrite).
- GPU-accelerated cellular automata app.
- Portable algorithms for carryless multiplication and exponentiation.

**Past Projects:** *(email me if you want to see something not public on github. I have to deal with silly academic policies)*
- [Tiny nkey rollover tester OS](https://github.com/robertmorelli/TinyNKRO.OS)
- Randomized Pacman game.
- Spreadsheet as a DLL compiler (constant cells get setters, formula cells get getters).
- Simple data binding language for websites.
- GPU-accelerated Game of Life.
- Funky SVG animation creator, like MS Paint for animations.
- LED controller for Corsair fans (still working on porting the performance meter from Python to Node).
